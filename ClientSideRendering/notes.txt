            Client side rendering

1. UI Rendering (Building Web Content)
 - Rendering means to dynamically generate content:
  * As opposed to having static HTML files;
  * Can be parts of a web page, or an entire web application;
  * Virtually all contemporary sites use dynamic generation;
 - Can be performed on the server and on the client(browser):

2.   Server-Side                vs               Client-Side

     Server-Side                                          Client-Side
 * User sends request                                 * User sends request
 * Server generates HTML                              * CDN serves files and JS
 * HTML is sent to the client                         * JS fetches data
 * Browser interprets HTML                            * JS generates DOM elements

***  Pros & Cons of Client-Side Rendering
  - Benefits:
   * The page is never reloaded, and interaction is instant;
   * State and data can be shared across views;
   * Only Dynamic content needs to be fetched after start;
  - Drawbacks:
   * Longer initial load times;
   * not SEO-friendly(Search Engine Optimization);
   * Poor performance with slow client machines;

3. Templating.
 - Templates allow similar content to be replicated in a web page,
  without repeating the corresponding markup everywhere;

4. Project Requirements
 - A templating engine generally allows:
  * Templates to be defined in files, separate from business logic;
  * A markup syntax close to HTML to be used;
  * Values to be inserted via rendering layouts;
  * Templates to be composed to create layers;
 - Additional features of some libraries:
  * Caching os template results;
  * Automating diff-checking and partial updates;
