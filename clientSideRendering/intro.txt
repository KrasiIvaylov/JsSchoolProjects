    * Rendering means to dynamically generate content
     - As opposed to having static HTML files

        * User sends requests               * User sends requests
        * Server generates HTML             * CDN serves files and JS
        * HTML is sent to the client        * JS fetches data
        * Browser interprets HTML           * JS generates DOM elements

    * Pros and Cons of Client-Side Rendering:
     - The page is never reloaded, and interaction is instant
     - State and data can be shared across views
     - Only dynamic content needs to be fetched after start
    * Drawbacks:
     - Longer initial load times
     - Not SEO - friendly(Search Engine Optimisation)
     - Poor performance with slow client software

    * Templating :
     - Templates allow similar content to be replicated in a  web page, 
        without repeating the corresponding markup everywhere
